# ðŸ†š VSCode Extension

![](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/lharri73.dbc?style=flat-square)

This extension provides basic syntax highlighting, bracket completion, code snippets, and syntax / parser errors for the Vector DBC file format.&#x20;

This is created to work with version 2 of the [Vector DBC file format](https://bitbucket.org/tobylorenz/vector\_dbc/src/master/).

Although DBC files are often programmatically generated, it can be useful to more easily read the DBC file itself in a plaintext format. Syntax highlighting is handled locally through VSCode's integrated TextMates language parsing engine, using PCRE regular expressions to match syntax.

### Supported keywords

```
  - BA

### Known Issues

1. Attribute definitions that wrap lines may not be highlighted on the following lines.
2. Multiplexed Signals are currently not recognized

### Todo

```
  - Make lexer and parser errors more useful
  - Add checks that prevent crashing when signals don't exist
  - Include debugging (invalid offset, start bit, min, max, etc)
  - Hover box to show all related fields as a hint
