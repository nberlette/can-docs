# #âƒ£ Version

This is quite often left blank, but it is **highly recommended** to follow **** [**semantic versioning**](https://semver.org)**,** or _**semver**_, to keep track of your changes and progression between versions and releases. In that same aspect, I also recommend taking advantage of a **version control system** like [**Git**](https://git-scm.org).

## Syntax

```
VERSION "[major].[minor].[patch][-<pre>.<id>]"
```

### Symbol

```
VERSION
```

## Examples

```
VERSION "2021.06.08"
VERSION "3.11.0"
VERSION "0.1.1-beta.1"
VERSION "1.0.0-rc.10"
```
