# ðŸ†• New Symbols

### Symbol

```
NS_ :
```

### Syntax

Located at the very top of the document, just after [**`VERSION`**](version.md).

This doesn't change much between documents, so I tend to use the same block in all of mine. Some of the symbols listed, such as `CAT_` are now deprecated and will not be included or examined in this specification.
